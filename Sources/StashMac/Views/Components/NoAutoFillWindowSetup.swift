/// instantiate the default one, the warm-up has nothing to render.

/// The interception happens via NSWindowDelegate's
/// `windowWillReturnFieldEditor(_:to:)` — when that returns non-nil,
/// AppKit uses it in place of its own default editor. SwiftUI assigns
/// its own internal delegate to the windows it creates, so we wrap
/// that delegate via a forwarding NSObject (`responds(to:)` +
/// `forwardingTarget(for:)`) and only add this single method on top.
/// Everything SwiftUI's delegate did before still happens; we just
/// inject one extra hook.

/// use elsewhere and falls back to its own pool when it is, so a
/// shared instance plus the same disabled flags is the canonical
